title: 'Upgrading Gatsby to MDX from Remark'

lead: "In which we add technology for technology's sake."

import TodoApp from './TodoApp';

As is my usual habit, once I've upgraded something I cannot resist continuously
tweaking with it until I get bored. In doing so, I frequently fail to actually
use the technology I setup, which leads me to wonder why I did it in the first
place. But no matter that now, we've added more technlogy!

Behold, a trivial Todo app _inside_ a blog post!

<TodoApp
  initialTodos={[
    'Create Todos',
    'Enter key to creates items',
    'Backspace deletes empty items',
  ]}
/>

How amazing is this? Right? I guess? Maybe I should explain what's happening
here.

[Last time] I mentioned that I was writing my blog posts in [Markdown] instead
of raw html. This is a huge quality of life improvement - pressing enter is a
lot simpler than ensuring my `<p>` tags are matched. But like all abstractions,
the simplicity comes at the cost of expressiveness.

As I read more about Gastby, it became clear that a Markdown extension called
[MDX] was the hot hotness these days, and I wanted to give it a try. What MDX
allows you to do is to interleave React components with standard Markdown, so
that you can have custom-made things appear instead of just text, headings, and
images (I'm underselling Markdown a bit).

I read quite a few articles while trying to figure out how to convert my
remark-based gatsby blog to an mdx-based blog, but as with most programming it
was a fair bit of combining sources and guesswork which allowed me to get this
setup just right. My primary sources were:

- [This post], which almost hits every point I need but uses screenshots of
  diffs instead of actual code, and isn't consistent about which side is which,
  so that sucked a bit.
- [The Gatsby docs on MDX], which unhelpfully use a starter instead of showing a
  migration, but [does have an excellent section on interop with remark].
- [This dream of a post], which doesn't tell me anything about how to migrate
  but gave me lots of other shiny things to think about like storybook.
- [This extensive post], which now that I'm done is really complete but honestly
  was too colorful and the font size too large for me to read it.

Now, you can just skip to the good part and [look at my diff], but the slightly
longer version is:

[look at my diff]: https://github.com/zandaleph/bookish-carnival/commit/9a29fce5c97cff88c60c802851548b99fe9664fc

- Add your dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`:
  `gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react`

- Update `gatsby-config.js`

  - Swap `gatsby-transformer-remark` for `gatsby-plugin-mdx`
  - If you had remark plugins, change `plugins` to `gatsbyRemarkPlugins`
  - You'll need to also add those remark plugins at the top level list of
    plugins _because they're not automatically resolved anymore_.

- Update `gatsby-node.js`'s `onCreateNode()` handler
  - When checking `node.internal.type`, Swap `MarkdownRemark` for `Mdx`
- Update your static GraphQL queries
  - Swap `allMarkdownRemark` for `allMdx`
  - Swap `markdownRemark` for `mdx`
    - Within that, swap `html` for `body`
- Update your templates
  - Instead of: `<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.html }} />`
  - Use: `<MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer>`
  - Don't forget: `import { MDXRenderer } from 'gatsby-plugin-mdx';`

Once you've done these few mechanical changes, you can try out MDX in your very
own markdown files! For example, to get the TodoApp earlier in the article, the
beginning of this post looks like:

```mdx
import TodoApp from './TodoApp';

Behold, a trivial Todo app _inside_ a blog post!

<TodoApp initialTodos={['Create Todos']} />
```

The only other thing I did to support my new capabilities was to install [syntax
highlighting for my editor (VSCode)], since MDX is still new enough that it
isn't supported right out of the box.

[syntax highlighting for my editor (vscode)]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=silvenon.mdx

Now, it turns out installing MDX was trivial compared to actually building the
Todo App I created to show off the new features. I spent an evening setting up
MDX, but getting the Todo App into a publishable state took another three or
four evenings. So my next post will be about building that sucker - where the
code was inspired by, why I didn't just use it as-is, and how bad I really am at
CSS. But for now, I hope this post helps someone shortcut their gatsby upgrade
to MDX, and they don't get nearly as distracted as I did actually using it.
