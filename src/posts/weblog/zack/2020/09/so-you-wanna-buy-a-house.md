I recently got a message from a friend asking for advice on buying a home.

> [My] questions at this point are mostly of "what should we be looking out
> for", "what do you wish you'd known", "what are we perhaps caring more about
> than we should be", and of course anything about the process itself.

Two hours and 100 messages later, I realized that I had more experiences and
opinions about homebuying than I had realized. I guess that happens after
buying three houses in a decade.

Rather than repeating this entire thread with the next friend who comes asking,
I thought I would take what I said in chat, edit it (sometimes heavily), and
post the whole thing here so I could just share a link in the future and answer
follow-up questions after that.

Before we get too much further, let me be really clear: **This is not meant to
be taken as 100% reliable.** I am not writing a carefully researched how-to
guide on homebuying here. Instead, I am sketching out broad strokes for _a_ way
to buy a house in hopes it might be useful to some of my friends someday. This
will be very US centric, possibly only applicable in my area of the US, and
almost certainly factually wrong at places. I may update this post later if I
hear of the latter.

In general, though, the steps are as follows:

1. [Set a Budget](#set-a-budget)
2. [Prepare a Mortgage](#prepare-a-mortgage)
3. [Prioritize Your Requirements](#prioritize-your-requirements)
4. [Tour Houses](#tour-houses)
5. [Make an Offer](#make-an-offer)
6. [Offer Acceptance and Closing](#looking-ahead)

Step 6 is complicated enough I'll make a separate post for it after this one and
link to it once it is complete. Think of this post as how to go from nothing to
a contract to purchase, and the next as how to execute that contract.

## Step 1: Set a Budget {#set-a-budget}

Houses are the most expensive things that most people will ever buy. The US has
entire industries built solely on connecting consumers with loans so they can
even think about affording a house. And with loans come payments, so you're
going to want to have a plan for how you'll pay off that fixed cost for the next
30 years.

Different people will tell you different numbers, but there's something that
says you should only allocate 30% of your pre-tax paycheck to paying
rent/mortgage payments. If you know what you generally make in a year, there
are calculators online that know the general going rate for mortgages and can
tell you how much you can afford to borrow.

The other consideration on how much to borrow is how much money you can bring to
the table.  Ideally, you'll bring at least 20% of the cost of the home to the
table.  With less than this mortgage lenders will require you to pay mortgage
insurance (PMI), an additional monthly payment on top of your normal payments,
until you actually own 20% of the value of your home.  With only 5% down, for
example, you'll be paying PMI for over 6 years.  PMI costs upwards of $200/mo,
so you'll need to add that to your budgeting considerations.

Finally - you can't cheat on bringing money to the table.  That means no loans
from family, or secondary loans to enable you to make a larger down payment.
Mortgage brokers are required to ask if you're doing these things, and the
reasoning is simple - they make your loan riskier.  Ideally, you'll also not
take out any other loans during the homebuying process either - no new car loans
or credit cards - as these can invalidate risk calculations and delay getting
your mortgage.

## Step 2: Prepare a Mortgage {#prepare-a-mortgage}

A mortgage broker is someone who can get help you get a mortgage.  They use
knowledge of your situation to find the best terms and rates.  Brokers get paid
a small fee from the bank for "originating" the mortgage, so they are motivated
to find serious homebuyers.  As such, expect to have a short conversation with
them about your budget and loosely what kind of home you're looking to purchase.

At this stage what you're looking for is a letter of pre-approval for your
budgeted amount.  It usually takes a day or two to get one of these.  You can
work with multiple brokers if you like to shop around, or if you're in a hurry
and just need one to get back to you quickly.

Redfin keeps a [pretty good list] of reviewed lenders in many US metro areas, I
recommend starting there if you can.

## Step 3: Prioritize Your Requirements {#prioritize-your-requirements}

Now that you've got your financial constraints figured out, it's time to get
the rest of your thoughts about the house you want organized.  Easily searched
properties like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage are good
starting points.  Other things to consider include:

* Location! How near you are to grocery, work, play, and friends can all factor 
  in to your decision.
* If you like entertaining, parking or ready access to transit can be important.
* Hobbies can often take up space, so a garage, basement, or extra bedroom might
  be on your list.
* With kids, a separate play space or fenced yard are very nice to have.
* With aging parents, a second kitchen or living space might let you care for 
  them more easily as they need more help.
* Floor plan - do you want an open floor plan? do you prefer stairs or need to
  avoid them?

You should plan to be in any house you buy for at least three years, so think
about your future needs as well as your present ones.

With all of these idea in mind, sit down and write out relative priorities:
which pieces are more important than others.  No house is perfect, so this
ranking is a tool you can use to a/ decide if a house is good enough to warrant
its cost, and b/ compare two houses which you're having a hard time deciding
between.

If you're following along, at this point you're probably feeling like you've
done a lot of work without looking at any houses.  This is intentional - all of
the work up until this point is necessary, but many people wait until they've
found a great house to lay this foundation.  The downside of that approach is
that a better prepared person might buy the house out from under you while
you're waiting for pre-approval or figuring out if the house really meets all
your needs.  In a competitive market, or if you need to be very particular,
hours can make a difference.

## Step 4: Find and Tour Houses {#tour-houses}

Now that you have all your requirements, you can start finding matching houses
and touring them to find your next home.  Traditionally, you'd find a buyer's
real estate agent and have a meeting with them where you outline your
constraints and let them find good matches for you.  This has the advantage of
letting their industry connections find you things before they're generally
available, and using their knowledge of the local market to gage how difficult
meeting your requirements will be.

Alternatively, you can use an online service like Redfin or Zillow to find 
houses listed for sale.  You'll build a list of specific houses you want to see
and then either go to open houses without an agent, or get an agent to schedule
private tours.  This has the advantage of being a bit faster to start touring,
as well as preventing you from looking at houses you know you'll never buy.

This step can take months, or it can be over in a weekend.  Housing inventory
is constantly changing, especially in larger cities, so if you don't find what
you want right away, it can be worth it to wait. Generally, new houses come on
the market Thursday or Friday.  If they're well priced they can go under
contract by Sunday, so you do need to keep your eyes open.

One final thing to keep in mind while searching - for a normal sale it takes 30
days from offer to keys in hand.  You can speed this up slightly by making an 
all-cash offer, but most people are not going to be able to afford that. If your
lease is up soon, you'll need to factor this delay into your search.

## Step 5: Make an Offer {#make-an-offer}

Once you've found a house you want to buy, you need to make an offer.  The
easiest way to do this is to have an agent do it.  This is a straightforward
conversation, and you can usually get your offer in on the same day.

One thing to note: agents can't directly answer the question "what price should
I offer for this house?"  They can show you what prices nearby similar homes
have gone for in recent months, but ultimately you have to decide the exact
number to put into your offer.

Offers are legally binding purchase contracts - once accepted, you're on the
hook to pony up the money you promised somehow (usually by getting a mortgage).
From this, you can understand why it is incredibly risky to have more than one
open offer at a time.  Thus, offers usually have a very short window for
acceptance - 36-72 hours is common.

Perhaps because of these short windows, there is definitely first mover
advantage when buying a home - frequently, the first offer received is the one
accepted.  As such, if you see a house you want, don't wait very long to make
an offer.

## Looking ahead {#looking-ahead}

Next time I get back to this topic, we'll talk about what happens after an offer
is accepted, up to getting keys after closing.  Until then, an agent can likely
help with all of that as well - after all, that's what they do every day.
Sometimes, though, it can be nice to know what's coming before it's upon you.
